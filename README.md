# Guess-The-Word
A mini-game inspired from the famous Wordle but instead of 5 letters, we are playing with 6. Its a bit more challenging.
The execution starts from Application.java file. The Folder Guess contains 2 java files from which Application.java imports functions and variables.
Here is a screenshot of what the game output looks like:

The game or rather code can be further customized and several games like Jumbled word guesser can also be added.
The current word library contains a 1000 6-letter words for the code to randomly choose from.
